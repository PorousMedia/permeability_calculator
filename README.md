**_About_**:
    perm_ calculator is a tool for rapid calculation of permeability from raw and processed MICP data. This will help save time spent on manually obtaining permeability estimates using Dastidar, Winland, Swanson, Wells, and Kamath models     
    See our paper for more details on the respective models: Ishola, O. and Vilc√°ez, J., Machine learning modeling of permeability in 3D heterogeneous porous media using a novel stochastic pore-scale simulation approach.

**_Code requirement(s)_**:
    install pandas:  "pip install pandas" see more information here: https://pypi.org/project/pandas/
    
**_How to use_**: 
    Download the .py file into the same folder you have your MICP data, then run the file.
    Please use python3. Also, the file holding the MICP data should be excel (xlsx) format.
    The code is interactive and will prompt you to enter some information about the file.
